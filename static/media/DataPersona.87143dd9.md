A data persona is a way of understanding organizational data activities, and also helps to chart a indualized learning path based on the knowledge and skills required to perform these activities. It is entirely possible to relate to more than one data persona. For example, a People/Program Manager may also perform the activities of a Data Steward, and a Data Steward may also be a Front Line worker.
