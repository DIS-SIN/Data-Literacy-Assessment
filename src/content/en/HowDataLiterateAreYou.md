Data literacy is the ability to understand, manage and communicate data as meaningful information.

Widespread data literacy is critical to enable a data-driven culture that is open, shares by default and realizes business value from data holdings. A data literate workforce is one that can use data to improve the quality of decisions and services; knows when and how to question validity of data; read, comprehend and use statistical information ethically; explore data to generate new ideas, methods and understanding; and represent information visually and communicate it to an audience.

This self-assessment is intended to create a baseline for individual and organizational competency assessments and recruitment initiatives, and to guide the development of learning pathways and resources that will provide foundational data literacy to all public service employees, as well as continuous development pathways for data-driven roles.
